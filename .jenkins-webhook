# Jenkins Webhook Trigger
# This file exists to inform developers that this repository triggers
# a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline located in the infrastructure repository.

Pipeline Location: https://github.com/sabiut/qr-checkin-infrastructure/jenkins/Jenkinsfile
Jenkins Job: qr-checkin-system-pipeline
Webhook URL: https://jenkins.vanuatucloud.com/github-webhook/

## How it works:
1. Push to this repository triggers GitHub webhook
2. Webhook triggers Jenkins pipeline in infrastructure repo
3. Jenkins pipeline checks out both app and infrastructure code
4. Pipeline builds, tests, and deploys the application

## Pipeline Stages:
- Checkout both repositories (app + infrastructure)
- Detect changes since last build
- Test server connectivity
- Build (Frontend, Backend, Docker images)
- Deploy to production (main branch only)
- Health checks

## Manual Trigger:
Visit Jenkins dashboard and run "qr-checkin-system-pipeline" job
