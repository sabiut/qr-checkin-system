## ü§ñ Claude Code Review

### ‚úÖ Security
No major security vulnerabilities found. Good use of Django's built-in protections.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Code Quality Issues
1. **Line 45:** Consider using `select_related()` to optimize this database query
2. **Line 128:** This view method is quite long - consider breaking it into smaller functions

### üéØ Suggestions
- Add input validation for the email field
- Consider caching the user profile lookup
- Document the gamification point calculation logic

### üí° Overall Assessment
Well-structured code following Django conventions. The feedback system integration is clean and maintainable.

## üö® Important Notes

- **API Costs:** Each review uses Anthropic API calls (typically $0.01-$0.10 per review)
- **Rate Limits:** Be aware of API rate limits for high-frequency PRs
- **File Size:** Very large diffs may be truncated to stay within token limits
- **Privacy:** Code diffs are sent to Anthropic's servers for review

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Workflow not running?
- Check that GitHub Actions are enabled
- Verify the workflow file syntax
- Ensure secrets are properly configured

### API errors?
- Verify your Anthropic API key is correct
- Check your API usage limits and billing
- Review the workflow logs for specific error messages

### No review comments?
- Check if the workflow completed successfully
- Verify GitHub token permissions
- Look for errors in the Actions logs
